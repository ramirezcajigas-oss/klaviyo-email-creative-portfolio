## 1) Klaviyo Lifecycle Flows (Retention)

### Welcome Series (3 emails)
**Goal:** first purchase + brand positioning  
**KPIs:** open rate, CTR, conversion rate, revenue per recipient

**Email 1 — Welcome + Best Sellers**
- Subject A: Welcome to [Brand] — here’s 10% off
- Subject B: Your new everyday essentials start here
- CTA: Shop Best Sellers

**Email 2 — Education + Social Proof**
- Angle: why the product fits daily life + comfort/quality proof
- CTA: Shop the collection

**Email 3 — Offer + Urgency**
- Angle: limited-time incentive + size/fit reassurance
- CTA: Complete your first order

### Abandoned Checkout (3 emails)
1) Reminder + friction removal  
2) Product benefits + review snippets  
3) Last chance + incentive (optional)

### Post-Purchase (2 emails)
1) Thank you + care instructions  
2) Cross-sell + UGC request

### Winback (2 emails)
- “We saved something you’ll love” + personalized picks

---

## 2) A/B Testing Plan (Copy + Creative)
**Testing cadence:** weekly  
**What I test:**
- Subject lines (curiosity vs benefit vs offer)
- CTA language (Shop Now vs Get Yours vs See Colors)
- Hero creative (product-focused vs lifestyle)
- Offer framing (free shipping vs % off vs bundle)

**Decision rules:**
- Low opens → improve subject/preheader + segmentation
- Low CTR → stronger hook, clearer CTA, better hero creative
- Low CVR → align landing page message + reduce friction (fit/returns)

---

## 3) Campaign Calendar (Example — 2 weeks)
- Tue: New arrivals / featured drop
- Thu: Education (fabric/fit/care) + soft sell
- Sat: UGC / reviews + best sellers
- Sun: Offer / bundle push

---

## 4) Creative Asset Development (Deliverables)
### Hang Tags (copy + layout notes)
- Front: brand mark + tagline
- Back: care info + QR to “fit guide” + social handles

### Labels (copy checklist)
- Brand name
- Size
- Fabric/material notes
- Care icons/text

### Size Charts (structure)
- Measurements by size
- “How to measure” diagram notes
- Fit guidance (“true to size”, “relaxed fit”, etc.)

### Ad Graphics (angles)
- Comfort / fit
- Quality / fabric
- Social proof
- Offer/bundle

---

## 5) Video Ad Editing Direction (Founder time saver)
**Goal:** reduce edit time by using repeatable templates.
- 3 recurring formats: UGC testimonial, product demo, lifestyle montage
- 5–7 second hook bank + on-screen text rules
- Edit checklist: pacing, captions, CTA end card, aspect ratios (9:16, 1:1)

2) Voice & tone (do/don’t examples)
